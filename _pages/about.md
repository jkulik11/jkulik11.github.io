Jackson Kulik is an Assistant Professor at Utah State University in the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department. He runs DyCE lab studying Dynamics, Control, and Estimation in the context of cislunar astrodynamics, rendezvous and proximity operations, and space situational awareness.

My primary interest at the moment is in addressing guidance, navigation, and control challenges by analyzing higher-order tensors for partial derivatives and statistical moments.

I completed my PhD at Cornell University in the Center for Applied Mathematics in Dmitry Savransky's [SIOSlab](https://sioslab.mae.cornell.edu/). I received a B.S. in Mathematics at Texas Tech University.
